# Research Project

## Overview
This research project analyzes forest degradation in the Omo Forest Reserve over a 15-year period (2008â€“2023). The analysis leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel-2, Landsat data, and other remote sensing techniques to track vegetation decline using indices like NDVI and LST.

## Features
- **Data Acquisition**: Retrieves Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 imagery from Google Earth Engine, filtered by date and cloud cover.
- **Cloud Masking**: Applies a cloud masking algorithm to filter out clouds and shadows from Landsat 8 images.
- **NDVI Calculation**: Computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess vegetation health.
- **LST Computation**: Derives Land Surface Temperature (LST) using thermal infrared bands.
- **Sentinel-1 Analysis**: Uses SAR data from Sentinel-1 to assess vegetation structure and backscatter variations over time.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Plots NDVI, LST, and backscatter values to visualize changes over the study period.
- **Shapefile Integration**: Loads and visualizes the study area from a shapefile hosted in Google Earth Engine assets.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Google Earth Engine API (`earthengine-api`)
- Geemap (`geemap`)
- Pandas (`pandas`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- SciPy (`scipy`)
- PIL (`Pillow`)

## Setup Instructions
1. Authenticate and initialize Google Earth Engine:
   ```python
   import ee
   ee.Authenticate()
   ee.Initialize()
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install earthengine-api geemap pandas matplotlib numpy scipy pillow
   ```
3. Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment:
   ```python
   python Research_Project.py
   ```

## Usage
- The script initializes an interactive map for visualization.
- It processes Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 images, extracting vegetation and temperature indices.
- The processed data is plotted for time series analysis.
- Outputs include NDVI and LST maps, backscatter comparisons, and time series plots.

## Outputs
- **NDVI Maps**: Visualizing vegetation changes over time.
- **LST Maps**: Indicating temperature variations in the study area.
- **Sentinel-1 Analysis**: Showing SAR backscatter differences over different years.
- **Time Series Plots**: NDVI, LST, and SAR backscatter trends over 15 years.

## Notes
- The Google Earth Engine asset ID for the region of interest (ROI) is `projects/ee-ayotundenew/assets/omo_forest`.
- The script uses Landsat 8 Collection 2, Tier 1, and Sentinel-1 GRD datasets.
- Cloud masking is applied to reduce errors in NDVI and LST calculations.
